# Lottery Program Guide

Welcome to the Lottery program guide. This guide will walk you through how to participate in and interact with the Aleo "Lottery" program. The Lottery program is a simple lottery system where participants can play for a chance to win.

## Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

- Aleo development environment set up, including access to the Aleo IDE and the Aleo blockchain.

## How to Use the Lottery Program

1. **Access the Lottery Program:**
   - Open the Aleo IDE and load the "Lottery" program.

2. **Play the Lottery:**
   - In the program, you'll find a transition called "play." This is where you can participate in the lottery.
   - Click on the "play" transition to get a lottery ticket.

3. **Ticket Ownership:**
   - The ticket is associated with your address, and you are the owner of the ticket.

4. **Lottery Rules:**
   - The lottery program has specific rules, including:
      - A maximum block height (adjustable in the code).
      - Random winning selection using the ChaCha random number generator.
      - A limit on the number of winners (e.g., 5 in this example).

5. **Check for Winnings:**
   - After playing and receiving a ticket, you can check if your ticket is a winner.
   - Analyze the blockchain and the lottery transition's results to see if your ticket is among the winners.

6. **Smart Contract Deployment:**
   - If you're the developer or owner of the lottery smart contract, you can deploy it on the Aleo blockchain. Others can then access and play the lottery by interacting with your smart contract.

7. **Winning Prizes:**
   - If your ticket is selected as a winner, you may receive prizes according to the lottery's rules. Prizes can be tokens, assets, or other digital items specified by the lottery creator.
